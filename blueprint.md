# Project Blueprint

## Overview

This is a simple task manager application that allows users to log in with their Google account and manage their tasks. The application is built using HTML, CSS, and vanilla JavaScript, and it uses Firebase for authentication and database services.

## Features

*   **Google Authentication:** Users can sign in to the application using their Google accounts.
*   **Task Management:** Users can create, view, mark as complete, and delete tasks.
*   **Real-time Updates:** The task list updates in real-time as changes are made.
*   **Dynamic Start Page:** The application features a dynamic start page with a cartoon-like fire-breathing dragon background for logged-out users, using a local `dragon.webp` image.

## Styling and Design

The application has a clean and modern design with a light theme. Key features include:

*   **Color Palette:** A light and airy color scheme with a white primary background, a light grey secondary background (`#f0f2f5`), and a vibrant blue accent color (`#007bff`). Text is a dark grey for readability.
*   **Typography:** The application uses the Poppins font, which is clean and easy to read.
*   **Layout:** The layout is responsive and works well on both desktop and mobile devices.
*   **Icons:** The application uses icons to enhance the user experience.

## Deployment

The application is deployed using Firebase Hosting and is accessible at [https://cytask.web.app](https://cytask.web.app).

## Version Control

The code is version controlled using Git and is hosted on GitHub at [https://github.com/Naf3tS/cytask](https://github.com/Naf3tS/cytask).
